   <p id="intro">The image of perfection achieved on the sales floor is merely a product of all the work and consequences behind it. From the countless hours of work that underpaid workers put in, to the tons of waste discarded by the garment industy, fashion definitely has its price. Major corporations do an incredible job of hiding the dark side of fashion under the glam of bright lights and beautiful models. However, everyone leaves a mark on Earth, and the clothes you wear could have the highest influence.</p>

   <h2 id="care">Why should we care?</h2>
    
   <p class="reasons" id="r1">The term "fast fashion" was only coined recently, as more companies have been trying to push out more in-season products for their customers. However, this comes at a price. Think about the clothes you just bought because your favorite influencer or celebrity wore in their last post. The trend won't stay for long, and those clothes will be out of style soon. Before long, you decide it's time to throw them out. These clothes, as well as the billions of other people in this same scenario, all contribute to the growing dump of clothes in landfills. There they sit, and there they remain, as these clothes take terribly long to decompose - if at all.</p>
   <br>

   <p class="reasons" id="r2">Companies like these, which outsource their labor to third-world countries, do not care for their employees or quality. Have you ever seen those Youtube videos with hauls from sites like Shein or Wish? This is a great example. They manufacture clothes made with synthetic products that never biodegrade, and since some dupes are practically unwearable, they land directly in the dumps. This does not even factor in the amount of water waste, oil spills, air pollution, and other environmental destruction caused by fast fashion.</p>
  <br>
   <p class="reasons" id="r3">Garment workers are treated very poorly, despite the long hours and low wage they are given. They risk their lives and wellbeing everyday they go to the factory, but still have no rights or safety. Large corporations capitalize on the cheap labor, since they know the workers are easily replacable if they try to fight back. As a result, companies like Zara and H&M earn billions in revenue, while their workers can't even reach a living wage. Some companies, such as Nike, were able to improve conditions, after being caught in scandals, but this is not enough. It is not fair that people are able to survive only when the company is exposed in a scandal.</p>
   <br>
   <p class="reasons"id="r4">Ignorance is not an option in situations like these. Many do not think twice about where their clothes come from, or the potential hazards and consequences it has. Not only economically, but socially, ethically, and environmentally as well. It is a common misconception that outsourcing labor to third-world countries stimulates the global economy. However, there are more cons than pros in this situation. For instance, the unemployment rates in America rise since most of the factory jobs are given to other countries. Adding on, since people in other countries are working for corporate chains that operate overseas, they lose the opportunity to focus on jobs that improve their own country. This leaves the places you see on your tags, such as Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, and Vietnam, reliant on international companies, and their situation only gets worse.</p>
