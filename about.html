  <p id="me">Hi, I'm Rusayla! I made this website as a project for Girls Who Code. I also have a huge interest in fashion, but I recently realized the potential grave impact my passion was having on the enviroment. That inspired me to be more cognitive of my ecological footprint. I learned how to make a difference, and I hope this website inspires others to do so as well.</p>
