        <li id="protest">One way to engage with your community to fight back against fast fashion is through protests. Despite protests by the workers, there has not been enough change to the system. Most of these labor areas do not have strict laws against the mistreatment of garment workers. People should fight against these unfair labor laws, and protests are a good way to spread awareness. A good place to start is by checking out one of these organizations <a class="click" href="https://www.borgenmagazine.com/5-organizations-who-are-in-the-fight-against-fast-fashion/"/>here</a>.</p></li>


        <li id="factory"><p>In 2013, a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, collapsed. This lead to the 2,600 workers getting injured, and the death of 1,100 more. These tragedies will only continue to occur if major corportations are allowed to treat their employees like this. Some companies, such as Nike, have made efforts towards imrpoving their workers' conditions. More businesses should follow Nike's lead, and offer their employees living wages and protection in thier work environment. Take part by advocating for businesses to be more involved in basic human rights and wages.</p></li>

        <li id="thrift"><p>Another way you can help is by saving the environment. You should avoid buying new clothes, as the materials used are harmful and can take 200 years or even more to decompose. If you do have clothes you want to get rid by composting, remember that the material has to be 99% biodegradable. This includes fabrics such as cotton and linen. Otherwise, give your clothes a chance to be repurposed by donating or selling them on thrift stores. Shopping there is also more productive than buying fast fashion from big corporations. Companies like <a class="click" href="https://www.thredup.com/"/>Thread Up</a> and <a class="click" href="https://www.depop.com/"/>Depop</a> are great places to start. Supporting small businesses helps you, the business, and the economy. Buying from them is a great alternative!</p></li>
